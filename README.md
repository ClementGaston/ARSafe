# Epilog Zing 16 â€“ Augmented Reality Assistant

This project leverages **Vuforiaâ€™s augmented reality technology** to guide users through the startup procedure of the **Epilog Zing 16 laser cutter**.  
**Vuforia** is a powerful AR development platform that enables the creation of interactive experiences using images and 3D models.

The application offers two distinct modes of use:

### 1. **Step-by-Step Startup Mode**
In this mode, users are guided through each step of the startup process with clear and interactive instructions.  
A virtual television appears above the laser cutter displaying each instruction, supported by images or videos for better clarity.  
Users can navigate through the steps using "Next" and "Previous" buttons located beneath the virtual screen.

### 2. **Information Mode**
This mode allows users to explore the laser cutter in augmented reality.  
**Interactive question mark icons** are placed on different actionable areas of the machine.
